## 1. Start

1. Clone the repository into a new folder for your new project.

2. Install needed dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the dev command

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The dev command will start Webpack and tell it to watch for changes in JS and SCSS files, to recompile the needed assets.

## 2. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```
